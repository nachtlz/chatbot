### ChatBot with OpenAI API

This is a simple project that utilizes the API provided by OpenAI to create a chatbot with Node.js. The chatbot will respond to all your questions and store all messages to maintain conversation context.

To use the application, you need to create a `.env` file where you'll create a variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY` and assign it the API Key from your OpenAI account. You can obtain this key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

After that, run `npm install` followed by `npm start` to launch the application.

Finally, this project was created on 02/05/2024, so the syntax of OpenAI may have changed.
