To use the application, you need to create a `.env` file where you'll create a variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY` and assign it the API Key from your OpenAI account. You can obtain this key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

After that, install dependencies 
```bash
npm install
```

 Run the application
 ```bash
 npm start
```
